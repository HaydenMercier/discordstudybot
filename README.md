# Discord Study Bot

Oh yeah also requirements I guess.

This bot is used to help me track study sessions and acts as an introduction to programming discord bots.

It can be ran by yourself by copying the program, adding it to its own token, and adding it to your own server.

It requires the various discord modules to run, along with some standard python modules.
